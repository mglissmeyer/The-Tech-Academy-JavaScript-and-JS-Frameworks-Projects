# The-Tech-Academy-JavaScript-and-JS-Frameworks-Projects



Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find a diverse range of classic games implemented in TypeScript using three popular JavaScript frameworks: Angular, Vue, and React. These games showcase my skills in frontend development across multiple technologies.

## Games

### 1. Connect Four

**Connect Four** is a classic board game where two players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a vertically suspended grid. The goal is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's discs.

### 2. Simon Says

**Simon Says** is a memory game where players must follow a sequence of colors and sounds produced by the game. The challenge is to remember and replicate the sequence correctly as it grows longer with each turn.

### 3. Rock Paper Scissors

**Rock Paper Scissors** is a classic hand game played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible outcomes are Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.

## Frameworks

These games are implemented using three different JavaScript frameworks:

- **Angular**: Angular is a robust framework for building web applications.
- **Vue**: Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **React**: React is a widely used JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Getting Started

To run these games locally or explore the source code, navigate to the respective game's directory within its framework folder and follow the instructions in the README file.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript used for building large applications.

## Explore and Play

Feel free to explore and enjoy these classic games implemented using your favorite JavaScript frameworks. They not only provide entertainment but also serve as examples of my frontend development skills across different technologies.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. Have fun playing the games!
